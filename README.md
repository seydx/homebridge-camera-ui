## Configuration

camera.ui installs itself in the homebridge directory under `/var/lib/homebridge/camera.ui/`

The database, recordings and a copy of the camera.ui config.json are stored locally in this folder and are never accessible to others. The settings can be changed directly via the interface or over homebridge-config-ui-x

## Defaults

Once you have installed and configured it you can access the interface via http://localhost:8081.

The default username is ``master`` and the default password is ``master``. When you log in for the first time, camera.ui will ask you to change your username and password.


## Example Config (minimal)


```
{
   ...
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "CameraUI",
            "name": "CameraUI",
            "port": 8081,
            "cameras": [ ... ]
        }
    ]
}

```

For a full config.json, please look at [Example Config](https://github.com/SeydX/homebridge-camera-ui/blob/master/example-config.json) for more details.

## Usage

### Dashboard

The Dashboard is the main page of the interface and offers a variety of widgets to customize it as you like. The widgets will expand over time. At the moment the following widgets are available for the dashboard:  Time, Weather, Uptime, Camera, Notifications, RSS Feed, Status, Charts (CPU Load, CPU Temperature, Memory Load), Shortcuts and Log

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/dashboard.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Cameras

Here are all cameras listed by room and show the current snapshot as a cover sheet

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/cameras.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Camera

If you select a camera you can watch the livestream directly in the browser. With the camera.ui player you can pause the stream, turn audio on/off or reload the stream.

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/camera.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Recordings

All images or videos recorded by motion are listed here. If AWS Rekognition is used, the label for the recording is also displayed, as well as the date and time. Using the filter function, the recordings can be filtered as desired

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/recordings.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Notifications

All motion events as well as system messages can be viewed here. Each notification has one or more labels to better categorize them. The filter function can also be used to filter the notifications as desired.

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/notifications.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Camview

Camview displays all camera streams in tiles, hiding everything unnecessary. Camview is great for giving a direct insight into the cameras. Also here the streams can be paused by the camera.ui video player, audio can be switched on/off, streams can be reloaded or viewed in full mode.

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/camview.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Log

All events that occur in the backend can be monitored via the built-in log. In addition, the log can be also be cleared or downloaded here.

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/console.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Config

Using the built-in editor you can easily edit your config.json. In addition, any errors are immediately displayed and thus avoided to save a faulty config.json

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/config.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Utilization

"Utilization" shows you a graphical overview of the system utilization.  Here you can see in real time how high the CPU utilization is, how high the CPU temperature is and how much memory is still free.

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/utilization.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

### Settings

On the settings page you can make ALL settings regarding your config.json and database. All parameters defined in config.json are directly configurable from this page. If camera.ui runs via "Homebridge" you can also set Homebridge relevant parameters here.

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/settings.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

## HomeKit Secure Video (HSV)

> HSV requires a Homebridge version of at least 1.4.0-beta.4 or higher. Otherwise HSV will not be enabled.

When the plugin is used with HSV, all recordings from HomeKit Secure Video are automatically transferred to camera.ui as well and stored for them. All camera.ui features like WebPush, Telegram notifications etc. will still work with HSV.

[How to configure cameras for HSV](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/configure-cameras-iph7bc5df9d9/ios)

## Motion detection

camera.ui offers a variety of options to detect and process motion.

### Videoanalysis

<img src="https://github.com/SeydX/camera.ui/blob/master/images/browser/videoanalysis.png" align="center" alt="camera.ui">

With this option camera.ui connects to the stream and compares frame by frame if there are changes. The zones and sensitivity can be set in the interface.

### HTTP

If the HTTP server is enabled for motion detection, calling the link can easily trigger motion.

Example:

`http://localhost:8123/motion?My+Camera`


### MQTT

If you have set up the MQTT client (Settings > System > MQTT), you can set the required parameters such as "Motion Topic", "Message" etc. via the interface (Settings > Cameras > MQTT).

**Motion Topic**: The MQTT topic to watch for motion alerts. The topic (prefix/suffix) should be unique, it will be used to assign the motion detected message to the desired camera.

**Motion Message**: The message to watch for to trigger motion alerts.

The message can be a simple "string" (e.g. "ON"/"OFF) or a JSON object. If the MQTT message is a JSON object like:

```json
{
  "id": "test",
  "event": {
    "time": 1234567890,
    "state": true,
  }
}
```

Then define the exact parameter under "Motion Message" so that camera.ui can read from it, eg:

```json
"motionMessage": {
  "event": {
    "state": true
  }
}
```

### SMTP

If the SMTP server is turned on and your camera is able to send an email when motion is detected, you can easily trigger motion through it, eg:

`From: My+Camera@camera.ui`
`To: My+Camera@camera.ui`

Please note that the camera.ui SMTP server is set in the camera settings (ip/port).

### FTP

If your camera is able to upload an image when motion is detected, then you can select the camera.ui FTP server as the destination. Very important here is. The path you enter via the camera's own settings page must be the camera name as defined in config.

Every time the camera tries to connect to the server, the camera.ui detects and takes the entered path to determine the camera.


## Image Rekognition

If HomeKit Secure Video (HSV) is disabled, camera.ui also uses image rekognition with Amazon Web Services to analyse, detect, remember and recognize objects, scenes, and faces in images. You can enable for each camera the image rekogniton and you can even set labels for each camera. For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.

This makes it possible to analyze every movement before this is stored or sent as a notification.

To use image rekognition, you need to set up a AWS account with an IAM user. More Infos: [AWS Image Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?nc1=h_ls&blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-cards.sort-order=desc)

## Notifications

camera.ui supports numerous notification options. Each of them can be conveniently set via the interface.

Since push notifications only work conditionally for websites (see PWA), you can easily work around this via third-party providers.

These would be e.g.

- Telegram
- Webhook
- Alexa
- Third party providers that support Alexa

Via Telegram, you even have the option to send picture or video along with text messages.
